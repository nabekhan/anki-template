## Embedding Options in Templates

Since Anki does not provide the ability to store data in templates, there are some issues with user preference settings in templates:

- Cannot sync across multiple devices
- Preferences may be lost when restarting Anki on some clients

To resolve these issues, you need to paste the formatted template settings below into the template code. This process involves two steps:

1. Open the card template settings in Anki. The method to access this varies by platform, so please refer to the official user documentation.
2. Find the "Front Template" of this template and paste the formatted template configuration you see on the settings page into the corresponding location. Below is an example image from the Mac version of Anki, other versions may display differently.

## Markdown support

The markdown format of the template is supported through ByteMD. If you want to preview it in real time while editing, you can use ByteMD's playground directly.

However, please note that not all plugins available in the playground are enabled in the template. For the specific list of enabled plugins, please refer to the template’s markdown renderer implementation.

Below are some of the available formats and examples.

### Markdown Basic Syntax

````markdown
I just love **bold text**. Italicized text is the _cat's meow_. At the command prompt, type `nano`.

My favorite markdown editor is [ByteMD](https://github.com/bytedance/bytemd).

2. Second item
3. Third item

const plugins = [

const editor = new Editor({
  target: document.body, // DOM to render
  props: {
    value: '',
    plugins,
  },
});

editor.on('change', (e) => {
  editor.$set({ value: e.detail.value });
});
```
